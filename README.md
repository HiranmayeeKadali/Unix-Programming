# Unix Programming
# Lab 1: UNIX Shell Scripting
This lab assignment consists of four tasks aimed at practicing shell scripting in UNIX environments. Each task focuses on a specific aspect of shell scripting, from handling dates to running commands in parallel.

# Tasks Overview:
+ Date Validation Script: Validate if a given date exists on the calendar, considering leap years and month boundaries.

+ Size Conversion Script: Convert a given number to bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes.

+ Directory Compression Script: Create a compressed version of a specified directory, ensuring proper permissions and warning for large directories.

+ Parallel Compression Script: Compress a large file using four different compression tools in parallel, retaining the smallest compressed file.

# Lab 3 Overview:
This project aims to enhance an existing compiler by transitioning its backend from emitting code for a hypothetical stack machine to generating assembly code for the x86-64 architecture on Ubuntu Linux.

# Key Features:
+ Compiler Enhancement: Modify the provided calculator language compiler to emit actual x86-64 assembly instructions.
+ Language Support: The compiler supports basic arithmetic operations and control structures like while loops and conditional statements.
+ Additional Functions: Implement support for factorial, binary logarithm, and greatest common divisor instructions.
+ Project Structure: Ensure the project follows a specific folder structure for easy navigation and management.
